# Hi there
In the last months I really dived deeper in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning, by spending a lot of my spare time on online courses, revisiting math and reading articles & literature. With this new knowledge backing me, I´m really motivated to tackle new projects and to dive even deeper into the exciting field of Data Science, especially in the topic of medicine and healthcare.
Currently I´m working as a software developer in a start up in the field of health care, in which I´got more into Machine Learning and Data Science. I finished university with a masters degree in electrical engineering at Techincal University of Berlin and during my studies I already came in touch with the topic of applied Machine Learning in the field of medicine.
